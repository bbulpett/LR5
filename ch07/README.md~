###"Strengthening Models with Validation"

Validation is a way to ensure that only appropriate data is stored in the application's database. Although _client-side_ validations can easily be done with HTML5 or javascript, this approach is less secure than the _server-side_ validations that we will now add to our Rails models.

To begin, open last app from Chapter 6 (guestbook04) in the text editor.
<sub>Alternatively, a new app can be created (i.e. "guestbook05") that is identical to ch06/guestbook04.</sub>
