#### Chapter 1

At the terminal / command prompt, enter the following command:
`~/projects$ rails new hello [--edge --dev]`

Here, `new` is the command which creates a new application and `hello` will be the name of that application. Before working with the new app, you must be "in" the app's directory. Use the command `cd hello` to _change directory_ into the app and run the following command to start the Rails server

`~/projects/hello$ rails server`
